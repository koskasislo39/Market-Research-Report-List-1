<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Structural Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non- Destructive Testing</li><li>Destructive Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerospace structural testing market includes two primary types: non-destructive testing (NDT) and destructive testing (DT). NDT evaluates materials and structures without causing damage, using methods like ultrasonic, radiographic, or magnetic particle testing to identify flaws while preserving the integrity of the component. In contrast, DT involves deliberately subjecting components to stress or extreme conditions until failure to understand their limits, material performance, and safety factors. Both testing types are crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of aerospace structures.</p></p>
